This loop itself actually exits almost immediately, and the system then just plays through each of the queued-up messages one after the other until its buffer is empty. In a real-world application, youâ€™d probably want to use asynchronous callbacks to handle sequences like this, but that tends to get messy, and simple iteration is good enough to demonstrate the basic functionality.');
